# 29-Number-Game
This is a simple 29 number game using Python programming language. The game illustrated here is between the player and the computer. 
There can be many variations in the game.

Rules and Approach

The player can choose to start first or second.
The list of numbers is shown before the Player takes his turn so that it becomes convinient.
If consecutive numbers are not given in input then the player is automatically disqualified.
The player loses if he gets the chance to call 29 and wins otherwise.
Winning against the computer can be possible by choosing to play second. 
The strategy is to call numbers till the multiple of 7 which would eventually 
lead to 29 on computer hence making the player the winner.
